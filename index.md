## Welcome to My Website!

This summer I'm delving into my web development both for my own interests and a position I'll be working at this summer! I hope to grow as a problem solver and expand my skills into other domains. Feel free to reach out to me at my email!

### A Quick Intro

This is my personal website that I created through Github Pages. Here, I'll be posting random blog posts and other updates to cool projects that I (hopefully) won't procastinate on.

### Contact

Want to contact me for a project or just want to talk? Feel free to email [here](mailto:hkbnguyen3@g.ucla.edu).
