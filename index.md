## Welcome to My Website!

This summer I'm delving into my web development both for my own interests and a position I'll be working at this summer! I hope to grow as a problem solver and expand my skills into other domains. Feel free to reach out to me at my email!

### About

I'm currently in university and hoping to start a career in technology. My interests include programming, mathematics, and the intersection between computers and society. I think that eventually computers will be even more widespread than they are right now and it is important to learn and understand them.

### Contact
