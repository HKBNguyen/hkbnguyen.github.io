## Welcome to My Website!

This summer I'm delving into my web development both for my own interests and a position I'll be working at this summer! I hope to grow as a problem solver and expand my skills into other domains. Feel free to reach out to me at my email!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HKBNguyen/hkbnguyen.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
